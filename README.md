## What

We use [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/) as our project management tool and to
ensure that commit messages are consistent we made this utility to check commit
messages when committing.

# Developing

Run `yarn` to install packages and then `yarn dev` to start developing.

To start developing simply run `yarn start` to start the development server.

## `test`

To test our code run `yarn test`. You should also ensure that the code you've
written is up to spec with `yarn lint:ts` and `yarn lint:style`.

# LICENSE
